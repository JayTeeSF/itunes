done:
  removed Rails dependency
  add dependencies to gemspec (Nokogiri)
  inject dependencies (e.g. Nokogiri, File)
  refactor [in progress]
  o  refactor Parser
     -  remove Paperclip(::Tempfile) depenency) [good e' nuff]
     -  remove File dependency [good e' nuff]
  o  add factory generate method direct to "Library", i.e. Library.generate => Generator.generate
  o  extract Rake task(s) from original Rails app
  o  Itunes XMLFile -> Library
  o  library -> Itunes XMLFile (in-progress)

todo:
  o  generator -- support non-alphanum characters (i.e. '&', as in "Count Basie & His Orchestra")

  o  support extra track attribute(s): location (update Generator, to use track.location, i.e. preview_url)
  o  map jamble tracks/playlists to Itunes::Library:: Tracks & Playlists

  o  re-organize:
     library - playlist - track
     library-file::generator, ::parser, (::playlist, ::track)

  o  behavior specs (left todo):
     - library
     - playlist
  ?  consider renaming to itunes_library (thus removing top-level anorexic "Itunes" module)
